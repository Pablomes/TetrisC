Tetris in C for Windows console

Second installment in "I was bored and made a quick game for the Windows console using C". Again, the code is probably even messier in this one.

I came back to it the next day, got 2 players working on it. Categorised everything into different files to make it easier on me. Then proceeded to make them messy again. Oh well. 

A family member made such a whitty remark about it being in black and white and looking like an old movie. Hahahaha so funny...

There's colour now.

I might try online one of these days...

I tried online. It works in local networks. You might need to give permissions to the app, depending on the ports you use. I swear it is only playing Tetris...

I don't think I ever want to touch this project ever again, or maybe I will, just to clean up some stuff. But no more features, I think.
